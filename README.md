## About the Project
### Review:
The purpose of the project is to check if the passenger is wearing a helmet during the riding, and start warning if not.
for this, we used the Raspberry pi camera.

### Audience:
* Rental companies.
* Parents.
* Optional: Police.

### Technological challenges:
* face detection
* Identify an helmet.
* Turn on alarm.
* Create a website for customers.
* work with Raspberry pi.

### expansion:
- When a user wants to rent a bicycle, he registered on the site and starts riding.
- Now, if he rides the entire ride with a helmet, he'll get a bonus.
- But, if he takes off his helmet, the alert starts, he doesn't get a bonus and he also gets an SMS and an email
with a picture of him without a helmet!
